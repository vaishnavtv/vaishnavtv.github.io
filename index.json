Most UAV systems use a combination of a gyroscope, an accelerometer, and a magnetometer to obtain measurements and estimate attitude.  Under this paradigm of sensor fusion, the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is the most popular algorithm for attitude estimation in UAVs. In this work, we propose a novel estimation technique called extended H2 filter that can overcome the limitations of the EKF, specifically with respect to computational speed, memory usage, and root mean squared error. We formulate our attitude-estimation algorithm using two distinct coordinate representations for the vehicle’s orientation: Euler angles and unit quaternions, each with its own sets of benefits and challenges. The H2 optimal filter gain is designed offline about a nominal operating point by solving a convex optimization problem, and the filter dynamics is implemented using the nonlinear system dynamics. This implementation of thisH2optimal estimator is referred as the extended H2 estimator. The proposed technique is tested on four cases corresponding to long time-scale motion, fast time-scale motion, transition from hover to forward flight for VTOL aircrafts, and an entire flight cycle (from take-off to landing).Its results are compared against that of the EKF in terms of the aforementioned performance metrics.","tags":[],"title":"Extended H2 Filtering for Attitude Estimation in Low Power Microprocessors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sunsoo Kim","Vaishnav Tadiparthi","and Raktim Bhattacharya"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1580675709,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580675709,"objectID":"23652b510ff494d9c57a5318ec299e9a","permalink":"https://vaishnavtv.github.io/publication/acc2020sunsoo/","publishdate":"2020-02-02T15:35:09-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/acc2020sunsoo/","section":"publication","summary":"Among   algorithms   used   for   sensor   fusion   for attitude  estimation  in  unmanned  aerial  vehicles,  the  Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is the most commonly used for estimation.

Governing equations are described using non-minimum coordinates to simplify descriptions of the structure’s kinematics. To minimize constraint drift arising from this redundant system, the direct correction method has been employed in conjunction with a novel energy-correcting scheme that treats the total mechanical energy of the system as a supplementary constraint. The formulation has been extended to allow tensegrity structures with compressible bars, allowing for further discussion on potential choices for softer bar materials. The benchmark example involving a common tensegrity structure demonstrates the superiority of the presented formulation over Simscape Multibody in terms of motion accuracy as well as energy conservation. The effectiveness of the energy correction scheme is found to be increasing with the extent of deformations in the structure.","tags":["1"],"title":"A Lagrangian Method for Constrained Dynamics in Tensegrity Systems with Compressible Bars","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sunsoo Kim","Vaishnav Tadiparthi","and Raktim Bhattacharya"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1578255816,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578255816,"objectID":"1cb834505f90376d05cb887c7e264314","permalink":"https://vaishnavtv.github.io/publication/scitechsunsoo/","publishdate":"2020-01-05T15:23:36-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/scitechsunsoo/","section":"publication","summary":"Attitude estimation using low-cost sensors on Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) drones is a challenging problem that has conventionally been solved by the Kalman filter. However, the Kalman filter algorithm has a few drawbacks of its own, namely in terms of assumptions about noise characteristics, memory use, and computation speed. We propose a H2 optimal framework for attitude estimation in the same sensor fusion paradigm that alleviates these issues. The estimation gain is computed offline for the linearized system about a chosen nominal point, thus eliminating the need to solve optimization in real-time. Furthermore, assumptions about the Gaussian nature of noise can be relaxed. We present the results comparing our algorithm and the Kalman filter showing improved computational efficiency for both slow and fast motions, at little or no cost to accuracy. These improvements make our proposed filter a favorable alternative to the Kalman filter for low-cost UAS.","tags":[],"title":"H2 Optimal Attitude Estimation of UAVs Using Sensor Fusion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vedang Deshpande","Niladri Das","Vaishnav Tadiparthi","and Raktim Bhattacharya"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1578255304,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578255304,"objectID":"8cb47e2c65b306cce3999e792534f8e7","permalink":"https://vaishnavtv.github.io/publication/scitechotnn/","publishdate":"2020-01-05T15:15:04-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/scitechotnn/","section":"publication","summary":"We discuss a novel method to train a neural network from noisy data, using Optimal Transport based filtering.
